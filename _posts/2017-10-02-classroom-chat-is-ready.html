<p>Being in a classroom prevent many colleagues from communicating with each other even for solving course related issues. The only solution that exists is using a chat App like Telegram , Facebook Messenger , WhatsApp ... But , unfortunately , all these apps require Internet and require typing in a keyboard which is time consuming. Classroom Chat is here to help you !</p>

<p>Based on Bluetooth , Classroom Chat , an open source App would help students to create one on one communication to easily chat without even using a keyboard. By just rotating your phone to one of the 4 positions (left side , right side , up , down) , your phone will send a preset message to your friend.</p>
<p>You could set your preset messages in the App Setting (up to 4 messages). If you would like to type your custom message to tell your friend something else , you have the ability to write whatever you want by just clicking the "+" button in the bottom right of the screen (Floating Action Button).</p>
<p>This App is open source , you could check all the source code in <a href="https://github.com/marwendoukh/ClassroomChat-Android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<p>This was a short blog post that I wanted to write to share with you my new mobile App. Stay tuned for more Apps in the near future.</p>
