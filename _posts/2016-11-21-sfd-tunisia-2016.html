<p>After participating in the last year edition of SFD (Software Freedom Day), this year I participated as a speaker from Mozilla Tunisia community. In this blog post I'll talk about my experience and all the important things happened there.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I started my journey too early ,4:30 am, to prepare myself and to get early to the bus. I traveled with different communities ISETchux , Esprit Libre and of course Mozilla Tunisia.</p>
<p>After 2 hours in bus talking to different friends, we arrived to Sousse and we joined other open source communities. Manel was there and she well prepared the Mozilla booth , I thank her too much !</p>
<p>In this SFD edition, Mozilla Tunisia had 3 talks :</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine about "IoT and open source"</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/arminvanzaafouri" target="_blank">Amine Zaafouri</a> about "Personal leadership"</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bash10" target="_blank">Bechir Nemlaghi</a> about "Rust", the new programming language by Mozilla</li>
<li><a href="http://mermi.xyz/" target="_blank">Manel Rhaiem</a> about "Gender equality"</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2069" align="aligncenter" width="430"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-2069" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pg_sfd2016.png" alt="SFD 2016 schedule" width="430" height="298" /> SFD 2016 schedule[/caption]</p>
<p>As shown in the schedule, my talk was the first one so I got to the conference room early to prepare my computer and do a final check of the slides.</p>
<p>The audience started coming, the room is full, and fortunately the stress level is fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RachedTN" target="_blank">Rached Alaya</a> helped me to prepare the stage and then gave me the mic : I said to myself: "You have the mic, the audience is ready ,Do your best !"</p>
<p>I started my talk by introducing myself and presenting the agenda.After that, I explained what is IoT, how it's growing worldwide and its two major issues:Privacy and Security.</p>
<p>I gave facts about that, I gave numbers from the HP report.The solution for this problems is OPEN SOURCE ! I explained how Open Source could helps us solve IoT issues and what are the tools , platforms and products that are ready in 2016.</p>
<p>Before talking about other special things happened in SFD, I would really thank my new friend <a href="https://tuxbang.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">Azzen Abidi</a>.He's really amazing ! He was always smiling during my conference and since he was at the front of the conference room, he helped me to handle the stress.After the presentation he asked me a great question,he focused on a real problem that frustrated many startups in Tunisia. Thank you man ! I'm proud to have a new great friend like you.</p>
<p>Just after my talk, Amine Zaafouri come on the stage to start his conference about "Personal leadership". He mentioned how he are different the one from the other and how this difference is helpful to build a great team.</p>
<p>His session was very interactive, we did many experiments and the results was surprising. One of them is a memory test.He shows us an image for 5 seconds, two persons from different personalities remembered different things for this same image.</p>
<p><span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="">The wisdom behind it: We are different , with this difference we build a better team! </span></span></p>
<p>Amine's conference is one of the best ones at the SFD.</p>
<p>Bechir gave a presentation about Rust, the new programming language built by Mozilla community and Manel about the gender equality.She mentioned how in our community we have a 50/50 men and women.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend Bechir and Manel presentations because I had to be at the Mozilla booth to answer the different questions about Mozilla projects.I felt very excited and happy when I talk and introduce Mozilla to people, specially when I convince someone to use Firefox or when someone say "Aframe is really awesome ! I want to learn more about VR".</p>
<p>We offered the opportunity for people to try Virtual Reality using our headsets, it was very funny ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>One of the best things at SFD is to meet your old and new friends from different communities, from different regions, from different backgrounds to talk about what we've done last year and what we're planning for.</p>
<p>Finally, the shows began and Rached Alaya announced who will win the prices of best community, best speaker and best workshop. <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/elacheche" target="_blank">Anis el Acheche</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nzoueidi" target="_blank">Naeil Zoueidi</a> and Mrs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hela-boucetta-1927102" target="_blank">Hela Boucetta</a> won this prices. Congrats ! ðŸŽ‰Â ðŸŽ‰Â ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>As usually, SFD was an opportunity to be inspired by great people. I wish to see more communities and other great projects next year ! Unleash your potential !</p>
