          <a href="/blog/2017/08/04/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>Artificial Intelligence have become one of the most important and interesting topics over the past few years , it gave computers the ability to "think" and to be "intelligent" . Unlike "old" programs and algorithms in which you should define and deal with every condition , AI algorithms can predict the action based on a training . What is AI ? What is Machine Learning ? What is Artificial Neural Network ? How could we train it ?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Before the AI era</h2>
<p>In old programs , the output does not change over time and does not learn from training . Every thing should be written in the source code , every input should be included in the program . Whenever you have a new or a change in your input , you should update your program . This can be a huge problem when dealing with data and input that change frequently , specially if you could not predict them .</p>
<p>Let's take the following example :</p>
<p>You have program that take the model and the speed of a car as an input and gives you fuel consumption as output . How could you develop this program ?</p>
<p>Let's think for a minute ...</p>
<p>We have to manage all the models , and for every model all the possible car's speed ! This is very hard ! and unfeasible !</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence will solve this problem ! Congrats !</p>
<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence ?</h2>
<p>An AI , is a program that given an input , it'll predict the output , even if it doesn't know any think about that specific input (It doesn't know fuel consumption of this specific model at this specific speed) ! How it predict that ?</p>
<h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>To build an Artificial Intelligence program , you have to train it using examples (many real car's consumption) . This way , your program will learn from this data and try to understand how car's consumption increase according to speed and car's model . The more data you give to your program , the more accurate it'll be : All this without any change in source code .So , how machine learning works ? How your program learn ?</p>
<p>Well ! It will do a Linear Regression to draw a line that cross the majority of points, like the following image :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3484" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3484" src="/blog/assets/linearregression.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="800" height="600" /> Linear Regression[/caption]</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<ul>
<li>X : represents car's speed .</li>
<li>Y: represents fuel consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Artificial Neural Network ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is how to train our program to learn about our data .As we've seen earlier , Linear Regression is one of the methods to do that .</p>
<p>Artificial Neural Network is a new technique in machine learning that is inspired by human neurons. It is composed by "neurons" which has inputs and according to the input it calculates a value as an output .</p>
<p>Back the our example , to solve our issue we have to build an ANN that have 2 inputs :car model and car speed and 1 output : the fuel consumption . How to train it in order to predict the fuel consumption ?</p>
<h2>How to train an Artificial Neural Network ?</h2>
<p>There are two best tools to build and then train an ANN (Artificial Neural Network):</p>
<p>-<a href="http://scikit-learn.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scikit</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow</a> : developed by Google for building advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>In our example , we should then build an ANN with 2 inputs , 1 output and we give it as many data as we can to train it . As we mentioned above , the neuron output depends on its input , so in each learning round (epochs) the output for the same input change to become more accurate .What !</p>
<p>I'll explain . Let's say in round 1 (the first epoch) , the output of the neuron is calculated according to the following equation :</p>
<p>0.4*input1+0.2*input2 = output</p>
<p>This will give an accuracy ,for example, of 70% of our ANN  .</p>
<p>In the second epoch , the ANN will try to improve the accuracy by changing the first equation , so it'll be for example :</p>
<p>0.46*input1+0.199*input2 = output</p>
<p>Giving this equation , the ANN will have an accuracy of 75% , so our ANN improved itself by learning from each epoch and each input.</p>
<p>In each epoch , our ANN calculates the accuracy of the model and tries to improve it in the next epoch . (You could set the number of epoch as you want).</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>AI is the evolution of computer algorithms that will surely help Humans make better decisions and to predict many things . Many big companies already started using AI in their products , like Google assistant , Alexa (Amazon) , Google search engine ...</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that we will see AI in more products and programs in the near future , hoping that it will beneficial for the end user .</p>

              <p>[caption id="attachment_3862" align="aligncenter" width="364"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3862" src="/blog/assets/macbook-setup.jpg" alt="macbook setup" width="364" height="364" /> Source : joeycariano Instagram account[/caption]</p>
<p>Working or studying from home is an issue for many people because they find all the entertainment stuff they want available for them and easy to access such as TV , video game console ... That is why many people prefer to finish all their tasks before going home because they are pretty sure that all their plans will fail .</p>
<p>But , what if we do not have the right to stay at work after 6pm and we should do some tasks from home ?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Motivation 🏊‍</h2>
<p>Motivation is a key for success . You should motivate yourself to stay focused on your work and to not get disturbed by all the things going is your home ,even if your baby cry.</p>
<p>I will share with you my personal tip that usually works great with me . Staying in front of a computer for 5 or 8 hours in a row to develop a software is not an easy task , so I motivate myself by saying :</p>
<p>"Hey Marwen ! if you do a great job today , you will go ride the bike , or you will watch your favorite TV series , it is up to you "</p>
<p>This way , I feel that after doing and finishing my work , I'll get a reward so I get motivated and work harder to obtain it .</p>
<h2>Stay focused 🎯</h2>
<p>Even with motivation , sometimes you find yourself distracted because of e-mails , notifications , phone calls , someone asks for your help ... To solve these issues try to respond to e-mail , messages once every 15min or 30min , because responding to everything as soon as you hear the notification will certainly make you loose your focus and you will notice that 1 hour has passed without doing any progress in your work.</p>
<h2>Stay organized 🕐</h2>
<p>Try your best to stick to the plan and commit yourself to do the tasks as you planned.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you plan to do Task 1 then Task 2 then .... you notice that you prefer doing Task 3 at first because all the other tasks needs more attention and more time.</p>
<p>Even so , try to do everything as planned and motivate yourself to do what you planned for because a good plan is the key for success.</p>
<p>That being said , you should know your skills and how much time it will takes to finish every task before setting the plan, and DO NOT plan for something that you could not accomplish (this will makes you feel down and you will underestimate yourself ).</p>
<h2>Go for a walk 🚶🏼</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above , staying in front of a computer for several hours is not an easy task and it could affect your health . So , once in a while try to go for a walk (even in the house) , this will make you willing to finish the remaining work with more motivation and of course protect your health.</p>
<h2>Finally Get the reward ! 🥇</h2>
<p>After finishing your work , and if everything worked like a charm , do not forget to get the reward that you promised yourself  to obtain. This will make you credible and next time you will work harder to get the reward !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that this article help you to do well in the future and if you have any other tips that could help us , please feel free to share it in the comment section below .</p>

          <a href="/blog/2017/06/19/firefox-what-is-next/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Firefox : What is next ?</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><img class="  wp-image-3576 aligncenter" src="/blog/assets/firefox.png" alt="Firefox" width="357" height="357" /></p>
<p>Firefox is getting many improvements over the last months , it is getting better day after day . What is next ? How Firefox could be the best alternative to Chrome ?</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Firefox marketshare</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-3581 aligncenter" src="/blog/assets/screenshot-2017-6-15-statcounter-global-stats-browser-os-search-engine-including-mobile-usage-share.png" alt="Browser marketshare May 2017" width="1354" height="190" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of May 2017 (according to <a href="https://statcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statcounter.com</a>) , Firefox have 6.21% of internet users (comparing to 54.14% to Chrome) . I wanted to know what are the main reasons of this decrease , so I asked many friends of mine : "Why don't you use Firefox and why you ditched it ?" .</p>
<p>I got almost the same answer : "I have been using Firefox since I have had Internet , but in the last few years I noticed that Firefox had many issues like lack of speed , lack of features and improvements . So I installed Chrome and I was amazed by its speed and simple user experience . Since then , I never thought to retry Firefox " .</p>
<p>Honestly , they are somehow right and we can not deny that .</p>
<p>Given all the issues mentioned above , I will give you some of the things that Mozilla will do to improve Firefox and to fix all its issues . This indicates that Mozilla is always listening to its users and always trying to improve !</p>
<h2>What Mozilla have done</h2>
<p>As you may probably know , Mozilla announced a new version of Firefox few days ago. This version have '<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/fast-responsive-reliable-browser-multi-tab-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electrolysis</a>' (e10s) turned on , which means that instead of using a single process to run all your web pages , Firefox will use up to 4 processes to run your web pages faster and smoother . Unlike Chrome which use a process per web page , Firefox found the right balance between memory usage and speed (more processes means more memory usage) . After updating to version 54 , you will notice that Firefox is faster , smoother and of course use less memory then Chrome.</p>
<p>Furthermore , <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/pocket-acquisition-mozilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla acquired Pocket</a> which is an app that let you manage your bookmarks and web pages that you need to read it later . Pocket will help Mozilla to improve the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Context_Graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Context Graph</a> project which aims to suggest to the users web pages and articles they may interest them .</p>
<p>In addition , you could <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/sync/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sync</a> all your browser history and bookmarks across all your devices . The best thing I like about this feature is when I visit a website from my mobile device and I want to see it later in my computer , I could easily send it to my PC .And as soon as I launch Firefox in my computer , a new tab of the website I have sent will be opened .</p>
<p>You could see all the other Firefox features <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What Mozilla will do</h2>
<p>Since <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/why-to-install-firefox-nightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I am using Firefox Nightly</a>  (the Alpha version of Firefox ) , I could notice the improvements daily and what will be added to Firefox . All I could say is "WOW !" .</p>
<p>First off , Firefox will get new visual refresh in the near future (project Photon) that started landing to Firefox Nightly to make its UI more simple.</p>
<p>As part of this UI refresh , the <a href="https://twitter.com/canuckistani/status/874667176216612864" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox logo</a> will also get some refinements . I am really excited to see what it will look like !</p>
<p>Second off , when you open a new blank tab , in addition to the top sites that you have visited , you will see suggestions of websites that you may want to visit (from Pocket , like I mentioned earlier) as well as the previous web pages that you just visited . This new feature will help you find your top sites faster and find new articles easier.</p>
<p>Moreover , Addons will get a big change and you will be able to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Porting_a_Google_Chrome_extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">port Addons across browsers</a> .</p>
<p>Many users struggle to take a web page screenshot, that is why Firefox will introduce a new feature called "Firefox Screenshots" . It aims to simplify screenshot taking and saving them online . (Just to tell you , I used it to take the above statistics screenshot). You could choose how long you want to keep the screenshot by setting the expiring period or you could simply save it to your computer . You could take a look <a href="https://screenshots.firefox.com/9m42FPbNpqnEfFgM/www.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to see an image taken using this new feature.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2016/08/25/mozilla-after-1-5-years-arabic-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my previous Blog post</a> (in Arabic) , I wrote about the "Containers" feature that allows you to connect to the same website with different accounts in the same browser ! Translation ? You could for example connect to many Gmail accounts in Firefox (without opening a private window) , one for your work , one for your personal use , and so on ... This feature give you more Privacy control over what data you share with websites.</p>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<p>I would like to invite you to switch back to Firefox because it is getting better day after day , specially with all the new features that I mentioned . Surely , it will be far better faster , and simpler than Chrome in the near future.</p>
<p>Of course , Mozilla won't stop here , it will improve Firefox more and more ... and more .</p>
<p>You could switch to Firefox by installing the latest version from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> . Don't worry about your browsing history and bookmarks , you could easily <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-data-another-browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">import them to Firefox</a> .</p>
