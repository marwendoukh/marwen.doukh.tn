          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>Being in a classroom prevent many colleagues from communicating with each other even for solving course related issues. The only solution that exists is using a chat App like Telegram , Facebook Messenger , WhatsApp ... But , unfortunately , all these apps require Internet and require typing in a keyboard which is time consuming. Classroom Chat is here to help you !</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on Bluetooth , Classroom Chat , an open source App would help students to create one on one communication to easily chat without even using a keyboard. By just rotating your phone to one of the 4 positions (left side , right side , up , down) , your phone will send a preset message to your friend.</p>
<p>You could set your preset messages in the App Setting (up to 4 messages). If you would like to type your custom message to tell your friend something else , you have the ability to write whatever you want by just clicking the "+" button in the bottom right of the screen (Floating Action Button).</p>
<p>This App is open source , you could check all the source code in <a href="https://github.com/marwendoukh/ClassroomChat-Android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<p>This was a short blog post that I wanted to write to share with you my new mobile App. Stay tuned for more Apps in the near future.</p>

              <p>New stats !</p>
<p>On the first day of each month , the latest statistics of browser marketshare is published by <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statcounter.com</a>. And this month is no exception.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_4660" align="aligncenter" width="1208"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4660" src="/blog/assets/browser-marketshare-september-2017.png" alt="Browser marketshare - September 2017" width="1208" height="120" /> Browser marketshare - September 2017[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-201707-201709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statcounter stats</a>, we could notice that Firefox marketshare has increased from 5.73% in July 2017 to 5.9% in August 2017 , to reach 5.96% in September 2017.</p>
<p>This increase is thanks to the hard work that has been done by the Mozilla community since years. I could remember well that many features has been landed in Firefox Nightly (pre-release version of Firefox for testing purpose) several months ago , and they went public recently. This shows how hard Mozilla has worked to develop, test , and improve this features before hitting the stable version.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/firefox-what-is-next/">previous blog post</a> that I have written in June 2017 (titled "Firefox : What is next ?") , I wrote about what Mozilla have done, will do , to improve Firefox and make it the most liked browser by all the Internet users.</p>
<p>Finally ! Mozilla's hard work is paying off and I expect that next month Firefox marketshare will be higher.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see Firefox 57 going to stable version. This new version that will be released next month will be the most revolutionary version Mozilla has ever made ! I promise you that Firefox marketshare will increase significantly after the release of Firefox 57.</p>
<p>If you want to find out what Firefox 57 will be like , checkout my blog post <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/firefox-what-is-next/">here</a>.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>[caption id="attachment_4340" align="aligncenter" width="333"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-4340" src="/blog/assets/personalsecret.jpg" alt="Personal secret" width="333" height="333" /> Image <a href="http://glossynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/notepassing.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Telling a personal secret to someone make you more happy and more relaxed because you have shared your happiness or maybe your pain with someone else , it's load balancing , you know ! This is what software engineers think about their personal stories.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>That's why , September 25th was an unforgettable great day for me because I've shared with my best friend our mutual secret that has been kept in the dark for months .... my hard work has paid off , finally !<br />
The result : I have gotten a fresh friendship (version 2.0) with the best friend that has made my life so awesome all long the past months , and we promised ourselves to remain friends as long as we are alive ! and the most important thing for me is that we share the same feeling towards each other.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not get what we are looking for and we are not able to achieve our goals due to many issues out of our control. That said, we should always keep in mind that life keeps its secret and will show them up at the right moment. This was a wise quote from my awesome friend , I will save it in my mind for my lifetime.</p>
<p>What happened two days ago , is thanks to the wise suggestions of someone that worked behind the scene , another great friend that helped me in my taught situation.</p>
<p>On July , I have invited my best friend to talk about our mutual secret but he was a bit confused so he didn't tell me noting . After two months , <strong>things have changed</strong> and he become now able to speak fluently about our friendship , congrats buddy for being so honest , you rock !<br />
Believe it or not : You should always say what you would say no matter what you are afraid of !</p>
<p>Being surrounded with great people not only make you more motivated to work hard and change the way you see the future , it also help you to live in the best conditions , that you could not find elsewhere. That's what I feel now after renewing my friendship with my best friend !</p>
<p>As you may probably know , airplane companies never close the case of an airplane crash only if it get all the details of what caused the issue in order to correct the previous errors and make the next edition better. It should get the truth , the true issue, not a fake cause , even if this may affect their brand. Applying this to my story , you could never have the best relationship , if you do not be as honest as you have to be and tell the right things to the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>Finally , my advice to you is you have to be honest , fluent with the people around you and always say the truth at the right moment to prevent issues from happening. Just run this code :</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="kwd">for</span> <span class="pun">(</span><span class="typ">Friend</span><span class="pln"> friend </span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> friends</span><span class="pun">)</span> <span class="pun">{</span>
    revealEverything<span class="com">(friend,Me.getFeelings());</span>
<span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one last thing that I would like to tell to my best friend :</p>
<p>"Be always honest with the people around you , always tell them what you feel about them. Also , have a self confidence and do not underestimate your <strong>POWER</strong> !!" . From your best friend Marwen.</p>

<p>My team and I , have participated in the <a href="http://movility.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoVility</a> 2017 challenge with our project "Happy Ho" and we won the third prize . In this article , I will tell you what we've learned during this event and why you should consider participating in next year's edition.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Before getting into it , I would like to thank every member in my team , Binary Team :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chawki-satouri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chawki Satouri</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amine-zouai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amine Zouai</a></li>

</ul>
<p>And I would like also to thank Mr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/messmedamin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mohamed Amine Messaoud</a> for his help all long the event .</p>
<p>We participated in the MoVility challenge with a project that we simply called it "Happy Ho" (as an abbreviation for happy hotel). The idea came up to our minds when deeply thinking about making feedback gathering as easy as possible , using technology. We noticed that the current feedback gathering processes takes too much time for both collecting and processing data.</p>
<p>That is why our innovative team made "Happy Ho" that will help Hotels to easily gather customer's feedback without bothering him nor taking too much from his time . It is a connected , intelligent Box that could be easily implemented inside the hotel . This Box will automatically measure the satisfaction rate related to the different hotel services, since many Boxes will be implemented near every Hotel service ( such as the restaurant , the swimming pool , the lobby ...)  That is a quick overview of our project , if you need more details please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

<h2 id="tts_button">Training sessions</h2>
<p>As part of the challenge, many training sessions had been planned that helped us to improve our project idea and to ameliorate our presentation skills specially that during the final the room will be full of very important people such as CEOs , Businessmen , Entrepreneurs ...</p>
<p>During these sessions we have learned a lot of new things and I want to mention the most important one for me which is :</p>
<p>"When you come up with a new idea , you should always keep in mind that it won't be successful only if it solves a customer's issue and it should be is very simple to implement and use ".</p>
<p>In the past , I used to got a lot of ideas that sounds very interesting but they do not succeed because simply the customer do not need all that complicated product !</p>
<p>Moreover , asking the customer if he likes your idea and if he is willing to buy it from you is always mandatory for the Startup success .</p>
<p>All long the workshops , we have done many presentations in which we have got many criticism and many great, constructive feedback that surely has been very helpful for us.</p>
<h2>The final</h2>
<p>The final was held in Citroën Club , in Lac 1 (Tunis, Tunisia) , so my team and I went early to get enough time for the preparation and to meet the other participants. Honestly, I liked how everyone is smiling and wishing the best to the participant teams.</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">Mr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oualid-triki-95a62242" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="gI">Oualid Triki</span></a> introduced the project and gave me the floor to present our idea in 5 minutes which was enough time for me to say Hi and to try to convince the room that our project solves a real issue and that they should invest in "Happy Ho".<br />
It was really great to present the project in front of CEOs and Businessmen specially that after the presentation , they gave me a lot of feedback and ideas . I will certainly improve the things that I have missed during my presentation .</div>

<div dir="ltr"></div>
<h2>The announcement</h2>
<p><img class="  wp-image-4143 aligncenter" src="/blog/assets/movility-2017-3rd-place.jpg" alt="MoVility 2017 3rd place" width="464" height="309" /></p>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">During the break, everyone got a cup of juice and started exchanging business cards  , there are plenty of opportunities out there , who knows ?</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">After talking about the possible opportunities with the attendees , it is time to announce who are the winners of MoVility 2017 challenge . We took a seat and we focused on the winners announcement. I was a bit stressed but I was sure that reaching this stage of the event and meeting all these people is the real win.</div>
<div dir="ltr">"The 3rd prize is for ...... Happy Ho! " applause ...   This is the best thing I have ever heard!</div>
<div dir="ltr">I can't feel better than winning such a great challenge . I want to thank once again all my teammates and the people that helped us to win .</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<h2>After the challenge ...</h2>
<p>Personally , this great journey helped me to improve my skills and to think differently about business specially when building the project idea.</p>
<p>After the challenge , we got a lot of new opportunities varying from jobs to partnerships. My team and I , are currently planning to build our startup and we committed ourselves to work hard to succeed this project.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the next year's winners will have better ideas , so if you are a student and you read this article , I highly recommend that you participate in MoVility in the next year and I hope that you start thinking about the winning idea starting from now. I would be glad if I could help you to build your idea by providing my feedback or even by providing technical support . Contact me when needed !</p>
