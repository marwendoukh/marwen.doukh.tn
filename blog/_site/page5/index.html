          <a href="/2017/06/15/why-to-install-firefox-nightly/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Why to install Firefox Nightly ?</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><img class="  wp-image-2781 aligncenter" src="/assets/firefox-nightly-logo.png" alt="Firefox Nightly logo" width="218" height="218" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people asks : "How can I help Mozilla ? I'm not familiar with programming !" . Then answer is "Use Firefox Nightly !".</p>
<p>In this blog post , we'll find out why Nightly is important and what you can do for Mozilla .</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2><img class=" size-full wp-image-2785 aligncenter" src="/assets/firefox_nightly_img.png" alt="Firefox Nightly" width="876" height="506" /></h2>
<h2>What is Nightly ?</h2>
<p>In software development process , any program version have a life cycle , like we Humans , Alpha , Beta and release .</p>
<p>Alpha is the version that contains the latest features and technology , it not available to public because it's unstable and under testing.</p>
<p>Beta is almost stable version of the software , but it needs more testing to make sure it does not contain bugs or security issues.</p>
<p>Release is the most stable version of the software and it is available to public . It has been tested for many weeks and almost all the issues were fixed by developers.</p>
<p>Back to the main topic , Nightly is the alpha version of Firefox , it contains the most newest Firefox features that are not available to public ,it is under continuous testing by the community.</p>
<h2>How can I help Mozilla ?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above , Nightly is unstable and contains the latest features , so Mozilla should test these features before making it publicly available .When installing Nightly , it will send anonymous data about how much RAM it consumes , how much it takes to start , how many times it crashes and the crash's cause ... (with all the respect to your privacy)  all those information will help the community to fix bugs and improve Firefox.</p>
<p>All the Mozilla community is working hard every day to make Firefox better whether by coding or testing. So you can be part of this and help to shape the next version of Firefox by simply installing Firefox Nightly and reporting any issue or bug you find.</p>
<p>If you want to test a more stable version of Firefox , you can install Firefox Beta from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> , it's the last chance to catch bugs before landing user's computers.</p>
<h2>What is coming next ?</h2>
<p>I've been using Firefox Nightly for more than a year , and during all this period , I'm receiving a new update every day , YES ! every day ! and I can notice that Firefox is improved day after day , new features are added , speed is improved , new privacy features are included regularly .</p>
<p>Since Mozilla is open , it shares periodically blog posts to tell the community what is coming next and what are the features that were added in the previous weeks , you can follow it by visiting the <a href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox Nightly blog</a>.</p>
<p>Finally , I would like to show you one of the most video I like , it summarize everything about Mozilla and I'm sure after watching it , you will set Firefox as your default browser.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtOGa5M8AuU&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>You can install Firefox Nightly from <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> .</p>

          <a href="/2017/06/06/introduction-to-iot/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Introduction to IoT</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>The IoT is becoming  among the most interesting topics over the last years because it will have a huge impact on our life in the next few years . According to experts , the world will see a big change at the dawn of 2020 , they called it : The IoT revolution !</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>What is the IoT ?</h2>
<p>IoT , stands for "Internet Of Things" . At the moment , no one have the exact definition of IoT because it's changing and growing day after day .</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/internet-of-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> defined it as : A network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with their internal states or the external environment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/06/what-is-the-internet-of-things-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardian</a> defined it as : it’s about connecting devices over the internet, letting them talk to us, applications, and each other.</p>
<p>My own definition for the IoT would be :</p>
<p>" The IoT is connecting  many devices over the Internet in order to gather , process and make decisions using its data ".</p>
<p>In fact , we called it Internet of THINGS because we don't know yet what are these THINGS . It could be a fridge , a TV , a sensor .... and any device connected to the internet .</p>
<h2>Why the IoT ?</h2>
<p>The world have had two technological revolutions . The first one was when the humans needed to exchange data and information between them =&gt; We had the computer revolution .</p>
<p>After many years , the humans required that the devices they use should be portable and smaller =&gt; We had the smartphone revolution</p>
<p>These two revolutions has successfully satisfied our needs in terms of Human To Human communication . But , the human needs has evolved again !</p>
<p>Nowadays , we have all the tools we need to communicate effectively but we need to communicate to our environment , we need to communicate with all the devices around us : the light bulb , the air conditioner , the traffic lights ... and the all the THINGS (like we defined them above) .</p>
<p>So , the world should have another revolution that makes the Humans to Things communication possible , and this is feasible only through the IoT revolution !</p>
<h2>How this could affects our life ?</h2>
<p>As I said above , nowadays we are no longer satisfied by the data we get from our environment. By environment I mean  every thing around us . Let's take the following example :</p>
<p>You have a garden with wonderful flowers and you are always looking after them . Imagine you get to travel for two weeks for job purposes . What a problem ! Your flowers will certainly die if they are not watered during all this period !</p>
<p>What if you have a smart watering system that monitor the ground moisture and that could fetch for the weather forecast ! Combining these two information : ground moisture and the weather forecast , we could ensure an effective watering system that could water the flowers if the ground is dry and that will not if it will be rainy in one hour . You could travel without the fear that you'll lost your flowers !</p>
<p>This is one of many examples for using the IoT in our daily life , I'll give you few applications for the IoT :</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical purposes : A device that periodically sends your grandma blood test results to the doctor and alerting him if anything went wrong.</li>
<li>Transportation : Locating the nearest bus and the time it takes to arrive.</li>
<li>Road traffic : Detecting the traffic jam and suggesting new ways for the drivers to avoid the congestion.</li>
<li>Health care : Detecting the expiry date of each product in the fridge and automatically ordering new products from the nearest supermarket .</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on ... The IoT applications can't have any limits since many IoT products shows up daily .</p>
<h2>Building the infrastructure</h2>
<p>The IoT is a topic that is highly linked to many other topics , we cannot talk about it without mentioning the Business Intelligence , network security , IPv6 , 5G , privacy (we will talk about it later) , power consumption , cloud computing ...</p>
<p>That's why we could not have an IoT revolution without carefully preparing the infrastructure for billions of devices (34 billion by 2020 according to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-internet-of-things-market-will-grow-2014-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">businessinsider</a> ).</p>
<p>Billions of devices connected to the internet simultaneously means we should ensure enough IP addresses for every device , so we should  deploy the IPv6 because the actual IPv4 can only ensure approximately 4.3 billion public IP address . I'll not dive into the details because it's not our main topic but , keep in mind that IPv6 can ensure approximately three hundred and forty trillion, trillion unique IP addresses (according to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>) .</p>
<p>Generally speaking, an IoT device is a totally independent device that is connected to the internet using wireless technologies like the future 5G that will ensure best data rate , low latency, best coverage than the actual 4G technology .</p>
<p>Once these devices got an IP address and successfully connected to internet , we should ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity , Availability of the data they'll send . The network security is fundamental and must not be treated as optional , we should not give the hackers any opportunity to intercept this data because it will cause the worst scenario you could image.</p>
<p>After that , we should ensure the platform that could handle Yottabytes of data (1 trillion terabytes) . Many companies started offering their cloud solutions but it should be improved more and more in order to be able to do the next step effectively : Processing that data .</p>
<p>Once the data landed safely on our servers , we will start our process that aims to extract the most valuable information from this data .In the past few years , many universities added the business intelligence as an important field of study to ensure the best engineers that will give this data a new life and to make best decisions .</p>
<h2>We should be careful !</h2>
<p>We talked above about how could our life be better and easier using the IoT . But , like any other technology , the IoT have some bad sides . Don't be afraid ! I'll give you the solutions to this problems .</p>
<p>The first thing that came to our minds when we talk about IoT is PRIVACY .More personal information about us will be stored in the companies servers : More IoT means Less privacy !</p>
<p>I'll illustrate it by the following schema :</p>
<p>more IoT devices ==&gt; more data ==&gt; more relevant information ==&gt; best profiling of you</p>
<p>Once they build your profile , they could show you targeted ads , they could know your needs so they manufacture a new products for you , they could make more money from your data .</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that most of the audience say :</p>
<p>" Who cares ! I have nothing to hide ! "</p>
<p>Yeah , you have the right to don't care , but keep in mind that combining the information of  you , your family , your neighbors , the  inhabitants of your city , the  inhabitants of your entire country , those information could be more dangerous ! Don't you agree ?</p>
<p>Another big issue has happened last month , when a hacker did the most big DDOS attack ever (sending too much requests to a server until he goes down) ! He used IoT devices to make this attack against big websites .</p>
<h2>So , what's the solution ?</h2>
<p>To ensure a healthy IoT world , we should first of all secure every information system we build : Security is mandatory ! We've moved some steps toward this goal by offering free TLS certificates from a project called "Let's encrypt" sponsored by many big companies.</p>
<p>The most important thing is using open solutions to build IoT systems and I'm very glad to see Mozilla working in this field. It's preparing awesome projects like Rust which is a programming language and Sensor Web which is a platform to collect data from different sensors worldwide and make its data available to anyone : for example , you can get the air quality in China without investing in sensors there .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion ...</h2>
<p>The IoT is an arm with two edges , either we use it in the right way to make better decisions and to improve our life , or we use it to destroy the internet, the internet that we've built for years !</p>
<p>I'm very optimistic for the future of the IoT , I'm pretty sure that it will make our life easier and helps us get more from our environment. We have to wait for 2020 to see what will happen !</p>

          <a href="/2017/04/04/face-detection-with-opencv/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Face detection with OpenCV</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><img class="  wp-image-3192 aligncenter" src="/assets/opencv-logo.png" alt="openCV logo" width="182" height="224" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OpenCV is an open source library for image processing and object detection. In this tutorial we'll create a Python program that detect and draw a rectangle around the detected face.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>To detect objects , openCV analyze the image and extract its characteristics and compare them to a classifier which is a file that describes the faces characteristics.</p>
<h2>What is a classifier ?</h2>
<p>A classifier (a file) is the result of analyzing each pixel of an image and extracting its characteristics. This file will be used to detect objects or persons in an image by comparing its characteristics with the classifier.</p>
<p>The more you train the classifier , the more accurate results will be .Classifier training is based on a dataset (images containing the object that you want to detect).</p>
<p>To illustrate :</p>
<p>If you want to create a classifier that detect cars in an image , you have to prepare a dataset of car images of all categories , colors , manufacturers ... try to prepare as much pictures as you can  : images of Volkswagen cars , BMW cars , black cars , white cars , 4*4 cars , sport cars and so on ...</p>
<p>The classifier needs this images (positive images) to understand how cars look like , but it needs also a dataset that contains negatives images , images that contains anything except cars : pictures of trucks , boats , airplanes ... You get the point.</p>
<p>In our case , detecting faces , openCV offers a trained classifier that was trained using hundreds of images and since its under a free to redistribute license , we'll use it in our project.</p>
<h2>Start developing</h2>
<p>First , we need to import openCV library for python :</p>
<pre>import cv2</pre>
<p>Since we'll give the file name in the program parameters , we need to import "sys"</p>
<pre>import sys</pre>
<p>Then import the openCV face detection classifier</p>
<pre>faceCascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')</pre>
<p>Import the image that its file name is given in parameters , it should be in the same directory as the python program.</p>
<pre>image = cv2.imread(sys.argv[1])</pre>
<p>Now, we'll do the most important part , detecting the face using the classifier.</p>
<pre>faces = faceCascade.detectMultiScale(
        #the image to use
        image,
        scaleFactor=1.1,
        minNeighbors=5,
        #specify the minimal object size , if it is smaller than 20*20 it will not be retained
        minSize=(20, 20)
    )</pre>
<p>Once the face is detected , let's draw a red rectangle around it</p>
<pre>for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
   cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x+w, y+h), (255, 0, 0), 2)</pre>
<p>Finally , show the final image and do not close it until the user press a button</p>
<pre>cv2.imshow("face", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Choose one of your face images , put it in the same directory as the python program and run:</p>
<pre>python face-detection.py yourface.jpg</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result will be like this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-3400 aligncenter" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-analytics-logo.jpg" alt="IBM Cognos Analytics logo" width="400" height="208" /></p>
<p>Cognos Analytics is an IBM Business Intelligence tool that you can use to interpret your data and extract relevant information for your Database.In this tutorial , we will add a new data source to Cognos Analytics , from DashDB , and create charts. Let's get started !</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>What is DashDB ?</h2>
<p>DashDB is a data warehouse developed by IBM that you can use to gather data from different databases and different sources.</p>
<h2>Connect DashDB to Cognos Analytics</h2>
<p>Connect to your Cognos account and click "manage" (in the bottom left) .</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3355" align="aligncenter" width="677"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3355" src="/assets/click-manage.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Click manage" width="677" height="296" /> Click manage[/caption]</p>
<p>Then , click "Data server connections"</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3359" align="aligncenter" width="675"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-3359" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-click-data-server-connections.png" alt="IBM Cognos : click data server connections" width="675" height="294" /> Click data server connections[/caption]</p>
<p>Click the + button and choose DashDB</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3363" align="aligncenter" width="1366"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3363" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-choose-dashdb.png" alt="ibm-cognos-choose-dashdb" width="1366" height="592" /> Choose DashDB[/caption]</p>
<p>Now , we have to enter the DashDB credentials , so go to your DashDB dashboard , click "connect" and copy , paste the required fields . (copy Host name and paste it in "Server")</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3366" align="aligncenter" width="1364"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3366" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-copy-your-credentials.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Copy your credentials" width="1364" height="591" /> Copy your credentials[/caption]</p>
<p>When you're done , test if the connection can be established by clicking "test" , you should see this</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3369" align="aligncenter" width="573"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3369" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-test-the-connection.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Test the connection" width="573" height="141" /> Test the connection[/caption]</p>
<p>After clicking the "Ok" button , click on the database you just created .</p>
<p>Then click on your connection name , and next to your schema name (DashDB table name) , click "Load metadata"</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3373" align="aligncenter" width="1364"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3373" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-load-metadata.png" alt="IBM Cognos : load metadata" width="1364" height="589" /> Load metadata[/caption]</p>
<p>As of now , we successfully connected Cognos to DashDB . The next step is to create a new data source for Cognos , it will get data from the server connection we just created .</p>
<p>Click the + button and choose "Data module"</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3376" align="aligncenter" width="1363"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3376" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-create-a-new-data-module.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Create a new data module" width="1363" height="588" /> Create a new data module[/caption]</p>
<p>Click "Data servers", then choose the "Data server" we just created .After that check the schema (DashDB table name) , and finally click "Start".</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3379" align="aligncenter" width="1364"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3379" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-setup-data-module.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Setup data module" width="1364" height="591" /> Setup data module[/caption]</p>
<p>Expand the "Data sources" , then drag and drop the table name you want to work on. Click "save" (on the top left).</p>
<p>Tip: Save it in "My content" folder to make it easier to find it later.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3382" align="aligncenter" width="1366"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3382" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-save-data-module.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Save data module" width="1366" height="589" /> Save data module[/caption]</p>
<p>Everything now is well set up . To use those data , add a new Dashboard</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3385" align="aligncenter" width="1363"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3385" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-add-new-dashboard.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Add new Dashboard" width="1363" height="591" /> Add new Dashboard[/caption]</p>
<p>In the new dashboard , we need to choose the data we want to process , so click the "+" button and choose the data source we just created (if you followed my tip , you'll find it in "My content" folder ;)  ).</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3388" align="aligncenter" width="1364"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3388" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-add-data-source-to-dashboard.png" alt="IBM Cognos : Add data source to Dashboard" width="1364" height="594" /> Add data source to Dashboard[/caption]</p>
<p>Finally , you can create your charts and process the DashDB data.Just drag and drop the values from your data source into your charts.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3392" align="aligncenter" width="1364"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3392" src="/assets/ibm-cognos-add-charts.png" alt="ibm-cognos-add-charts" width="1364" height="591" /> Add charts[/caption]</p>
<p>Enjoy !</p>
<p>Don't forget to save your Dashboard , so you can consult it in the future.</p>
