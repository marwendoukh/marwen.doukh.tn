<p>After participating in the last year edition of SFD (Software Freedom Day), this year I participated as a speaker from Mozilla Tunisia community. In this blog post I'll talk about my experience and all the important things happened there.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I started my journey too early ,4:30 am, to prepare myself and to get early to the bus. I traveled with different communities ISETchux , Esprit Libre and of course Mozilla Tunisia.</p>
<p>After 2 hours in bus talking to different friends, we arrived to Sousse and we joined other open source communities. Manel was there and she well prepared the Mozilla booth , I thank her too much !</p>
<p>In this SFD edition, Mozilla Tunisia had 3 talks :</p>
<ul>
<li>Mine about "IoT and open source"</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/arminvanzaafouri" target="_blank">Amine Zaafouri</a> about "Personal leadership"</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bash10" target="_blank">Bechir Nemlaghi</a> about "Rust", the new programming language by Mozilla</li>
<li><a href="http://mermi.xyz/" target="_blank">Manel Rhaiem</a> about "Gender equality"</li>
</ul>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2069" align="aligncenter" width="430"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-2069" src="/blog/assets/pg_sfd2016.png" alt="SFD 2016 schedule" width="430" height="298" /> SFD 2016 schedule[/caption]</p>
<p>As shown in the schedule, my talk was the first one so I got to the conference room early to prepare my computer and do a final check of the slides.</p>
<p>The audience started coming, the room is full, and fortunately the stress level is fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RachedTN" target="_blank">Rached Alaya</a> helped me to prepare the stage and then gave me the mic : I said to myself: "You have the mic, the audience is ready ,Do your best !"</p>
<p>I started my talk by introducing myself and presenting the agenda.After that, I explained what is IoT, how it's growing worldwide and its two major issues:Privacy and Security.</p>
<p>I gave facts about that, I gave numbers from the HP report.The solution for this problems is OPEN SOURCE ! I explained how Open Source could helps us solve IoT issues and what are the tools , platforms and products that are ready in 2016.</p>
<p>Before talking about other special things happened in SFD, I would really thank my new friend <a href="https://tuxbang.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">Azzen Abidi</a>.He's really amazing ! He was always smiling during my conference and since he was at the front of the conference room, he helped me to handle the stress.After the presentation he asked me a great question,he focused on a real problem that frustrated many startups in Tunisia. Thank you man ! I'm proud to have a new great friend like you.</p>
<p>Just after my talk, Amine Zaafouri come on the stage to start his conference about "Personal leadership". He mentioned how he are different the one from the other and how this difference is helpful to build a great team.</p>
<p>His session was very interactive, we did many experiments and the results was surprising. One of them is a memory test.He shows us an image for 5 seconds, two persons from different personalities remembered different things for this same image.</p>
<p><span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="">The wisdom behind it: We are different , with this difference we build a better team! </span></span></p>
<p>Amine's conference is one of the best ones at the SFD.</p>
<p>Bechir gave a presentation about Rust, the new programming language built by Mozilla community and Manel about the gender equality.She mentioned how in our community we have a 50/50 men and women.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend Bechir and Manel presentations because I had to be at the Mozilla booth to answer the different questions about Mozilla projects.I felt very excited and happy when I talk and introduce Mozilla to people, specially when I convince someone to use Firefox or when someone say "Aframe is really awesome ! I want to learn more about VR".</p>
<p>We offered the opportunity for people to try Virtual Reality using our headsets, it was very funny ðŸ˜…</p>
<p>One of the best things at SFD is to meet your old and new friends from different communities, from different regions, from different backgrounds to talk about what we've done last year and what we're planning for.</p>
<p>Finally, the shows began and Rached Alaya announced who will win the prices of best community, best speaker and best workshop. <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/elacheche" target="_blank">Anis el Acheche</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nzoueidi" target="_blank">Naeil Zoueidi</a> and Mrs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hela-boucetta-1927102" target="_blank">Hela Boucetta</a> won this prices. Congrats ! ðŸŽ‰Â ðŸŽ‰Â ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>As usually, SFD was an opportunity to be inspired by great people. I wish to see more communities and other great projects next year ! Unleash your potential !</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>On a commencÃ© le mois de Novembre avec des nouvelles !</p>
<p><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> , un site web spÃ©cialisÃ© dans les statistiques des navigateurs et systÃ¨mes d'exploitations , a annoncÃ© que l'usage des terminaux mobiles , smartphone et tablette , a dÃ©passÃ© pour la premiÃ¨re fois l'usage des ordinateurs . Quelle est l'importance de cette information ? Que va-t-elle changer dans l'avenir ?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pourquoi ce changement ?</h2>
<p><img class="  wp-image-1547 aligncenter" src="/blog/assets/internet_usage_2009_2016_ww.png?w=680" alt="internet_usage_2009_2016_ww" width="625" height="341" /></p>
<p>L'image ci-dessus , nous illustre l'augmentation de l'usage des terminaux mobiles depuis 2009 jusquâ€™Ã  2016 . En 7 ans , le marchÃ© est inversÃ© !</p>
<p>Pour plusieurs internautes le smartphone est devenu un besoin vitale , il est dÃ©sormais leur nouveau ordinateur portable Ã  cause de son prix rÃ©duit (par rapport aux ordinateurs), sa taille , et surtout pour la connectivitÃ© Ã  Internet : tous ces facteurs ont contribuÃ© a cette rÃ©volution qui va , certes , changer beaucoup de choses .</p>
<h2>Qu'est-<b>ce </b>qui va changÃ© ?</h2>
<p>Cette information est trop importante pour les dÃ©veloppeurs pour qu'ils adaptent leurs produits pour les mobiles . A partir de maintenant , il faut que tous les dÃ©veloppeurs web changent leurs sites web vers des sites "Responsive" , c'est Ã  dire qui s'adaptent a tous les tailles des Ã©crans , donc ils facilitent plus la navigation depuis les smartphones.</p>
<p>Pour les sociÃ©tÃ©s , avoir une application mobile est devenu primordiale pour atterrir le maximum de clients , puisque 51% des internautes utilisent le mobile .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La rÃ©volution des mobiles a commencÃ© depuis des annÃ©es , et aujourd'hui ils ont dominÃ© le marchÃ© de l'Internet . A l'aube de 2020 , les experts prÃ©voient une autre rÃ©volution mais cette fois-ci une rÃ©volution de l'IoT (Internet des objets). Comment sera notre vie dans 4 ans ? Et comment on peut assurer l'infrastructure pour ces milliards d'objets connectÃ©s ?</p>

<p>The Mozilla Arabic Gathering is an event that gathers all the Mozilla Arabic community in one place to discuss about the new Mozilla projects and to make our strategy for the next years .<br />
I was one of the attendees of this event in Casablanca , Morocco , from October 21th to October 24th 2016. So , in this article I'll try to summarize what happened there :)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>The event from my point of view</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1273" align="alignright" width="420"]<img class="alignright  wp-image-1273" src="/blog/assets/img_0_burst20161021092955_cover.jpg?w=1024" alt="Mozilla Tunisia traveling to Morocco for the Arabic gathering 2016" width="420" height="315" /> Mozilla Tunisia traveling to Morocco for the Arabic gathering 2016[/caption]</p>
<p>After 2h:30 , we landed safely in Mohamed V airport to join other Mozilla communities :</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Egypt</li>
<li>Mozilla Algeria</li>
<li>Mozilla Jordan</li>
<li>Mozilla Morocco</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very fascinated by the kindness of all the Mozillians , they made me feel like I'm in my home , everyone is smiling , everyone is joyful .</p>
<p>We started the event by making a code of conduct that everyone of us should respect during all the event . After that , the show began ! <a href="https://www.nukeador.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben</a> started with the introduction about the Mozilla mission and some historic facts of Firefox.</p>
<p>The introduction made us very excited about the next sessions , I weren't able to wait for the second day to learn about the campus clubs , so I seized the opportunity in the lunch to ask <a href="https://bacharakis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christos</a> and thanks to him I corrected many wrong information I had.</p>
<p>In the second day and after the morning's sessions , we planned for the what's next . It was the mostÂ crucial part of the event because we discussed and argued about our strategy . Every member gave his opinion , it was a constructive discussion . We'll do our best to do what we agreed on .</p>
<h2>What I've learned ?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question , because I should write a whole article to describe the things I've learned . Briefly , I learned about the Mozilla Campus clubs , the Rust programming language and how to communicate with people that doesn't understand your accent , specially with the Egyptian community , we had a lot of funny moments with all the community members.By the way , I would thank them all especially <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mohamed7afezz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mohamed Hafez</a> .</p>
<p>In our code of conduct , we committed ourselves to be honest , and I'll be in this article . Before traveling to Morocco , I thought that the Mozilla employees are "superior" than us (the contributors) and we should be very careful about every thing we say to them . BUT ... after meeting <a href="https://bacharakis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christos</a> , <a href="https://www.nukeador.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben</a> and <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pierros</a> , everything changed in my mind . They are very modest , they are awesome ! They answered all our questions , we shared all our thoughts with them .</p>
<h2>My best moments !</h2>
<p>I've had too much fun with all the Mozillians during this event , but there are two best moments that I can never forget .</p>
<p>The first one was when I had a deep discussion with Christos about Mozilla Campus Clubs in the dinner . I was able to ask all my complicated questions and to understand the reason why Mozilla changed the Firefox Student Ambassadors program .</p>
<p>My second best moment was when I joined a room party with a group of Mozillians in one of the hotel rooms . It was an awesome night with hours of non stop laughÂ ðŸ˜ƒÂ Â  All the stress has gone !</p>
<h2>To summarize ...</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1295" align="alignright" width="373"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-1295" src="/blog/assets/20161023_143231.jpg?w=680" alt="Christos speech in the Arabic gathering 2016" width="373" height="224" /> Christos speech in the Arabic gathering 2016[/caption]</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arabic gathering 2016 was held in Casablanca</li>
<li>About 30 Mozillians were present</li>
<li>The main topics mentioned during the event were :
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Campus Clubs</li>
<li>MozVR : Mozilla Virtual Reality</li>
<li>Rust programming language</li>
<li>Reps next</li>
<li>Mozilla Arabic community strategy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more by searching for #mozarab16 in social medias.</p>
<p>The Arabic Gathering did well its goal : everyone learned about the Mozilla strategy and it made everyone excited to contribute more and to spread the Mozilla mission everywhere . I really hope that I'll be present at the next Mozilla events and to do great projects with all the Arabic community . Mozilla ! Keep the web open , safe and available to everyone .</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-974 aligncenter" src="/blog/assets/slim-framework.png" alt="slim-framework" width="1791" height="409" /></p>
<p>Hello !</p>
<p>In this tutorial , you'll find out how to create your own web service using the Slim Framework and why it's important to create a web service.</p>
<p>Let's get started !</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>if you are familiar with the web services terms , you can skip the definitions and start developing your first web service <a href="#start-developing">here</a> .</p>
<h2>What's a web service ?</h2>
<p>A web service is a secure way to offer the database data to other applications .Iâ€™d like to illustrate my point with an example : Imagine you have a database that contains many personal data of your users and you would like to give access to some data to other developers, How can you do it ?</p>
<p>Without the web services , you have to give the developers the database server address , the database login and password , then the developers will have full access to your database which is a bad solution !</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ The solution is creating a web service that offers only the data needed , so the developers will not get your database credentials thus they will not have full access to your database .</p>
<p>You get the point .</p>
<h2>Introduction to Slim Framework</h2>
<p>Slim framework is a great PHP framework that will let you create your own web service without spending too much time .It's open source and well documented .</p>
<h2>Â JSON</h2>
<p>To put it simply , JSON is a text based format used to transmit data between two different apps . So , our data will be structured in a universal format in such a way that others apps will be able to process it easily .</p>
<p>Too much annoying details ? So let's start developing our first web service .</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2 id="start-developing">Develop your web service ðŸ˜Ž</h2>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Getting the data (JSON)</h6>
<p>First, we should define our route , in this example when we visit yourdomain/cars it will call the method 'getCars'</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<pre><code>
$app-&gt;get('/cars','getCars'); 
</code></pre>
<p>Then we should define our 'getCars' method which will return all the cars contained in the Database .To do that , we have to write our Sql query</p>
<pre><code>
$sql = "SELECT manufacturer,color FROM car ORDER BY id";
</code></pre>
<p>Then , execute the query</p>
<pre><code>
$db = getDB();
$stmt = $db-&gt;query($sql);  
$cars = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
</code></pre>
<p>and finally return the data as JSON with this line of code</p>
<pre><code>
echo '{"Cars": ' . json_encode($cars) . '}';
</code></pre>
<p>The 'getCars' method will be :</p>
<pre><code>
function getCars() {
	$sql = "SELECT manufacturer,color FROM car ORDER BY id";
	try {
		$db = getDB();
		$stmt = $db-&gt;query($sql);  
		$cars = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);
		$db = null;
		echo '{"Cars": ' . json_encode($cars) . '}';
	} catch(PDOException $e) {
	    echo "Error !"; 
	}
}
