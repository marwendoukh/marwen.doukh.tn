<p>New year , new you !</p>
<p>What if you start this new year with a bunch of new tools that would help you to stay safe online and protect your privacy ? Sounds good ?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Why you should care ?</h2>
<p>Internet was built to make the communication between people easier and faster. But nowadays , we could not use Internet without being tracked by third-parties (Facebook , Google , NSA ...). Who do not want to chat with his friend privately ? Who do not want to browse the Internet without seeing ads following him whenever he tape something in search engines ?</p>
<p>Everyone needs to be safe and communicate with his lovely friends and family without leaving his chat history in Big Brother servers.</p>
<h2>What should we do ?</h2>
<p>It's easy to protect your privacy online just by using the following tools. Let's get into get !</p>
<h3><img class="  wp-image-4756 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/firefox-logo.png" alt="firefox logo" width="164" height="170" /></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Firefox</h3>
<p>It's an open source web browser <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made by Mozilla</a> , the non-profit organization that fights to protect our privacy.</p>
<p>Mozilla is well known by its decisions against surveillance and you could see what it has done to <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/net-neutrality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defend Net Neutrality</a>.</p>
<p>It has also worked hard to <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rise public awareness</a> about privacy by making <a href="https://irlpodcast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online podcasts</a>.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-4757 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/signal-logo.png" alt="Signal logo" width="164" height="164" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Signal</h3>
<p>It's a Snowden-approved <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communication App</a> that help you to use the most secure encryption algorithms to communicate with your friends.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2016/09/09/why-end-to-end-encryption-is-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">End-To-End encrypted</a> by default , does not leave any logs on the server and provide voice and video calls.</p>
<p>In 2016 , <span class="copyright">Open Whisper SystemsÂ  (the developer of Signal) <a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has received a request from FBI to get information about two Signal users</a> . And since Signal does not store any useful information about its users once the message is delivered and read , it gave the FBI only two useless information which are the registration date and the last time the user connected to the server.</span></p>
<p>This App is <a href="https://twitter.com/snowden/status/778592275144314884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsed by Snowden</a> (see also <a href="https://twitter.com/snowden/status/661313394906161152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/726364395383693312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>) and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/how-the-clinton-campaign-is-foiling-the-kremlin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used by Hillary Clinton</a> after the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNC emails revelation</a>.</p>
<h3><img class="  wp-image-4758 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/https-everywhere-logo.png" alt="HTTPS Everywhere logo" width="164" height="164" /></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">HTTPS everywhere</h3>
<p>It's an Addon <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made by EFF</a> that will redirect all your traffic to websites to the HTTPS version.</p>
<p>Eg: If you hit " http://www.google.tn " , it will automatically redirect you to " https://www.google.tn ".</p>
<p>Then , all your traffic will be encrypted so your ISP will not know what you are seeing in the website or what link you are visiting. You ISP and any man-in-the-middle will only know that your browsing Google without knowing what you are searching for.</p>
<h3><img class="  wp-image-4759 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/privacy-badger-logo.png" alt="privacy badger logo" width="165" height="120" /></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">Privacy Badger</h3>
<p>It's an <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Addon</a> that let you block invisible trackers. Since many websites integrate invisible trackers that will follow you across many websites that you visit , this Addon will help you block them.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-4760 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dataselfie-logo.png" alt="dataselfie logo" width="164" height="165" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">DataSelfie</h3>
<p>It's well known that Facebook know many things about you , more than your own family !</p>
<p>This <a href="http://dataselfie.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Addon</a> will analyze your Facebook browsing and give you insights about your personality and the things that you like / hate , political opinions , the friends that you contact the most , and many other things based on what you do on Facebook.</p>
<h3><img class="  wp-image-4761 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/protonmail-logo.png" alt="Protonmail logo" width="320" height="51" /></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">ProtonMail</h3>
<p>This is an <a href="https://protonmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encrypted email service</a> that provides end-to-end encryption. Your emails will be <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-vs-gmail-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more secure than Gmail</a> (according to Protonmail).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The most important thing !</h2>
<p>All the tools that I have mentioned will certainly help you to browse securely and protect your privacy BUT the most important thing is YOU , how you use the Internet ? what you share online ?</p>
<p>Try to not share your sensitive information and try to share the minimum data as you could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally , and as Mozilla said :<em><strong> BROWSE FREELY !</strong> </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
