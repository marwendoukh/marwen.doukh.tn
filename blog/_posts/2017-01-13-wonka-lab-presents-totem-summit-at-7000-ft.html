<p><i>“Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.” - Albert Einstein</i></p>
<p>Emboldened by Albert Einstein’s words, the <a href="http://www.wonkalab.com" target="_blank">Wonka Lab</a> team looked to nature as the place of inspiration for their first ever, three-day <a href="https://www.totemsummit.com/" target="_blank">Totem Summit</a> launching on March 26, 2017. Serendipitously, they discovered Whistler, B.C. as the ideal place where rivers, mountains, and people meet.</p>
<p>Having been to numerous conferences around the world, the team felt the brief introductions made there lacked personal touch and lasting impressions. As mentioned above, the networking opportunities you take as a young company is critical to future success. With this in mind, the team explored an alternative way to bring innovators, investors, and entrepreneurs to new heights. They chose Whistler not only because it has vast possibilities for shared experiences, but because Whistler has proven itself as a hotbed for testing innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Whistler B.C. is the most connected resort community in the world and the best place to get your fill of snowy adventures in North America. The summit has something to offer for everyone: entrepreneurs looking for new opportunities, sport enthusiasts craving thrill, corporate innovators searching for their next star, and industry influencers vying for the spotlight. This one-of-a-kind conference adds play to work by providing attendees a chance to network through curated adventure activities like: snowboarding, skiing, snowmobiling, bobsledding, rejuvenating in an outdoor Nordic-inspired spa, attending unique storytelling sessions, and soaking in cultural marvels. All meant to build strong and lasting relationships.</p>
