<p>The Mozilla Arabic Gathering is an event that gathers all the Mozilla Arabic community in one place to discuss about the new Mozilla projects and to make our strategy for the next years .<br />
I was one of the attendees of this event in Casablanca , Morocco , from October 21th to October 24th 2016. So , in this article I'll try to summarize what happened there :)</p>

<h2>The event from my point of view</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1273" align="alignright" width="420"]<img class="alignright  wp-image-1273" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img_0_burst20161021092955_cover.jpg?w=1024" alt="Mozilla Tunisia traveling to Morocco for the Arabic gathering 2016" width="420" height="315" /> Mozilla Tunisia traveling to Morocco for the Arabic gathering 2016[/caption]</p>
<p>After 2h:30 , we landed safely in Mohamed V airport to join other Mozilla communities :</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla Egypt</li>
<li>Mozilla Algeria</li>
<li>Mozilla Jordan</li>
<li>Mozilla Morocco</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very fascinated by the kindness of all the Mozillians , they made me feel like I'm in my home , everyone is smiling , everyone is joyful .</p>
<p>We started the event by making a code of conduct that everyone of us should respect during all the event . After that , the show began ! <a href="https://www.nukeador.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben</a> started with the introduction about the Mozilla mission and some historic facts of Firefox.</p>
<p>The introduction made us very excited about the next sessions , I weren't able to wait for the second day to learn about the campus clubs , so I seized the opportunity in the lunch to ask <a href="https://bacharakis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christos</a> and thanks to him I corrected many wrong information I had.</p>
<p>In the second day and after the morning's sessions , we planned for the what's next . It was the mostÂ crucial part of the event because we discussed and argued about our strategy . Every member gave his opinion , it was a constructive discussion . We'll do our best to do what we agreed on .</p>
<h2>What I've learned ?</h2>
<p>This is the hardest question , because I should write a whole article to describe the things I've learned . Briefly , I learned about the Mozilla Campus clubs , the Rust programming language and how to communicate with people that doesn't understand your accent , specially with the Egyptian community , we had a lot of funny moments with all the community members.By the way , I would thank them all especially <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/mohamed7afezz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mohamed Hafez</a> .</p>
<p>In our code of conduct , we committed ourselves to be honest , and I'll be in this article . Before traveling to Morocco , I thought that the Mozilla employees are "superior" than us (the contributors) and we should be very careful about every thing we say to them . BUT ... after meeting <a href="https://bacharakis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christos</a> , <a href="https://www.nukeador.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruben</a> and <a href="http://pierros.papadeas.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pierros</a> , everything changed in my mind . They are very modest , they are awesome ! They answered all our questions , we shared all our thoughts with them .</p>
<h2>My best moments !</h2>
<p>I've had too much fun with all the Mozillians during this event , but there are two best moments that I can never forget .</p>
<p>The first one was when I had a deep discussion with Christos about Mozilla Campus Clubs in the dinner . I was able to ask all my complicated questions and to understand the reason why Mozilla changed the Firefox Student Ambassadors program .</p>
<p>My second best moment was when I joined a room party with a group of Mozillians in one of the hotel rooms . It was an awesome night with hours of non stop laughÂ ðŸ˜ƒÂ Â  All the stress has gone !</p>
<h2>To summarize ...</h2>
