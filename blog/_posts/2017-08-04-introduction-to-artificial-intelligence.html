<p>Artificial Intelligence have become one of the most important and interesting topics over the past few years , it gave computers the ability to "think" and to be "intelligent" . Unlike "old" programs and algorithms in which you should define and deal with every condition , AI algorithms can predict the action based on a training . What is AI ? What is Machine Learning ? What is Artificial Neural Network ? How could we train it ?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Before the AI era</h2>
<p>In old programs , the output does not change over time and does not learn from training . Every thing should be written in the source code , every input should be included in the program . Whenever you have a new or a change in your input , you should update your program . This can be a huge problem when dealing with data and input that change frequently , specially if you could not predict them .</p>
<p>Let's take the following example :</p>
<p>You have program that take the model and the speed of a car as an input and gives you fuel consumption as output . How could you develop this program ?</p>
<p>Let's think for a minute ...</p>
<p>We have to manage all the models , and for every model all the possible car's speed ! This is very hard ! and unfeasible !</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence will solve this problem ! Congrats !</p>
<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence ?</h2>
<p>An AI , is a program that given an input , it'll predict the output , even if it doesn't know any think about that specific input (It doesn't know fuel consumption of this specific model at this specific speed) ! How it predict that ?</p>
<h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>To build an Artificial Intelligence program , you have to train it using examples (many real car's consumption) . This way , your program will learn from this data and try to understand how car's consumption increase according to speed and car's model . The more data you give to your program , the more accurate it'll be : All this without any change in source code .So , how machine learning works ? How your program learn ?</p>
<p>Well ! It will do a Linear Regression to draw a line that cross the majority of points, like the following image :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3484" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3484" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/linearregression.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="800" height="600" /> Linear Regression[/caption]</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<ul>
<li>X : represents car's speed .</li>
<li>Y: represents fuel consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Artificial Neural Network ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning is how to train our program to learn about our data .As we've seen earlier , Linear Regression is one of the methods to do that .</p>
<p>Artificial Neural Network is a new technique in machine learning that is inspired by human neurons. It is composed by "neurons" which has inputs and according to the input it calculates a value as an output .</p>
<p>Back the our example , to solve our issue we have to build an ANN that have 2 inputs :car model and car speed and 1 output : the fuel consumption . How to train it in order to predict the fuel consumption ?</p>
<h2>How to train an Artificial Neural Network ?</h2>
<p>There are two best tools to build and then train an ANN (Artificial Neural Network):</p>
<p>-<a href="http://scikit-learn.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scikit</a></p>
<p>-<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow</a> : developed by Google for building advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>In our example , we should then build an ANN with 2 inputs , 1 output and we give it as many data as we can to train it . As we mentioned above , the neuron output depends on its input , so in each learning round (epochs) the output for the same input change to become more accurate .What !</p>
<p>I'll explain . Let's say in round 1 (the first epoch) , the output of the neuron is calculated according to the following equation :</p>
<p>0.4*input1+0.2*input2 = output</p>
<p>This will give an accuracy ,for example, of 70% of our ANNÂ  .</p>
<p>In the second epoch , the ANN will try to improve the accuracy by changing the first equation , so it'll be for example :</p>
<p>0.46*input1+0.199*input2 = output</p>
<p>Giving this equation , the ANN will have an accuracy of 75% , so our ANN improved itself by learning from each epoch and each input.</p>
<p>In each epoch , our ANN calculates the accuracy of the model and tries to improve it in the next epoch . (You could set the number of epoch as you want).</p>
<h2>To conclude</h2>
<p>AI is the evolution of computer algorithms that will surely help Humans make better decisions and to predict many things . Many big companies already started using AI in their products , like Google assistant , Alexa (Amazon) , Google search engine ...</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that we will see AI in more products and programs in the near future , hoping that it will beneficial for the end user .</p>
