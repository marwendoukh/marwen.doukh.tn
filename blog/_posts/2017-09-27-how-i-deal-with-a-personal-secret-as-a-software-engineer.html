<p>Telling a personal secret to someone make you more happy and more relaxed because you have shared your happiness or maybe your pain with someone else , it's load balancing , you know ! This is what software engineers think about their personal stories.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>That's why , September 25th was an unforgettable great day for me because I've shared with my best friend our mutual secret that has been kept in the dark for months .... my hard work has paid off , finally !<br />
The result : I have gotten a fresh friendship (version 2.0) with the best friend that has made my life so awesome all long the past months , and we promised ourselves to remain friends as long as we are alive ! and the most important thing for me is that we share the same feeling towards each other.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not get what we are looking for and we are not able to achieve our goals due to many issues out of our control. That said, we should always keep in mind that life keeps its secret and will show them up at the right moment. This was a wise quote from my awesome friend , I will save it in my mind for my lifetime.</p>
<p>What happened two days ago , is thanks to the wise suggestions of someone that worked behind the scene , another great friend that helped me in my taught situation.</p>
<p>On July , I have invited my best friend to talk about our mutual secret but he was a bit confused so he didn't tell me noting . After two months , <strong>things have changed</strong> and he become now able to speak fluently about our friendship , congrats buddy for being so honest , you rock !<br />
Believe it or not : You should always say what you would say no matter what you are afraid of !</p>
<p>Being surrounded with great people not only make you more motivated to work hard and change the way you see the future , it also help you to live in the best conditions , that you could not find elsewhere. That's what I feel now after renewing my friendship with my best friend !</p>
<p>As you may probably know , airplane companies never close the case of an airplane crash only if it get all the details of what caused the issue in order to correct the previous errors and make the next edition better. It should get the truth , the true issue, not a fake cause , even if this may affect their brand. Applying this to my story , you could never have the best relationship , if you do not be as honest as you have to be and tell the right things to the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>Finally , my advice to you is you have to be honest , fluent with the people around you and always say the truth at the right moment to prevent issues from happening. Just run this code :</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="kwd">for</span> <span class="pun">(</span><span class="typ">Friend</span><span class="pln"> friend </span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> friends</span><span class="pun">)</span> <span class="pun">{</span>
    revealEverything<span class="com">(friend,Me.getFeelings());</span>
<span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one last thing that I would like to tell to my best friend :</p>
<p>"Be always honest with the people around you , always tell them what you feel about them. Also , have a self confidence and do not underestimate your <strong>POWER</strong> !!" . From your best friend Marwen.</p>
