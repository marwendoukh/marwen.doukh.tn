<p>During 2016 we've seen many great products that changed our life and also there are a lot of news happened that affected the tech world like the US election. There is always something new to come in the tech world , and obviously 2017 will not be an exception. In this blog post , I'll tell you, briefly, my expectations for this year 2017.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>HTTPS</h2>
<p>In 2016, we've experienced a big increase in the HTTPS adoption by many websites .And this become a must-have for every website developer because user privacy is mandatory nowadays. Mozilla and many other big companies have sponsored a project called <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let's encrypt</a> which offers free TLS certificates for everyone.Recently, Mozilla announced that more than 50% of web pages visited by Firefox users were secured by HTTPS . This is a very important step toward a secure web .I expect that 2017 will be the year of HTTPS and I hope that more and more websites will be secured with HTTPS.</p>
<h2>Encrypted chat Apps</h2>
<p>Whatsapp , the 1 Billion users chat App announced that it can't access the content of the messages sent by its users because they are end-to-end encrypted. Same for Viber , Telegram (secret chat) , and Signal . The Snowden-approved chat App Signal , announced that it has an increase in its App download especially after the US election. Using one of these Apps , you can privately connect to your friends and family without being watched by big companies , governments and hackers. I expect that 2017 will be the year in which we can connect securely to our friends.</p>
<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
<p>In 2016 , Mark Zuckerberg showed us an amazing demo for Facebook plan for the VR (Virtual Reality). Google also announced that Youtube is able to deliver a live 360Â° video , so you can attend an event 1000 miles away without leaving your home !</p>
<p>With many projects like Aframe (a Mozilla library for creating VR scene using HTML) , I expect that in 2017 we can visit many countries , attend Mozilla , Google , Apple events without leaving home , playing games in VR scenes ...</p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Lately in 2016 , we heard a lot about IA assistants like Google Assistant and Jarvis which is an AI assistant announced by Mark Zuckerberg. In 2017, I expect that AI will be integrated in most of 2017's products and help us make things done.</p>
<h2>2017 wishes</h2>
<p>I wish that Firefox , will get more market share because , honestly, it deserves to be the first browser in the world. In this moment , Mozilla is working on many privacy features for Firefox in its Nightly version (Alpha version) as well as integrating Rust into its browser, this will make it way faster.</p>
<p>Let's work hard to make our future better and let's put one foot in front of another everyday !</p>
