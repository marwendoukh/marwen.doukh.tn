<p>New stats !</p>
<p>On the first day of each month , the latest statistics of browser marketshare is published by <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statcounter.com</a>. And this month is no exception.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-201707-201709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statcounter stats</a>, we could notice that Firefox marketshare has increased from 5.73% in July 2017 to 5.9% in August 2017 , to reach 5.96% in September 2017.</p>
<p>This increase is thanks to the hard work that has been done by the Mozilla community since years. I could remember well that many features has been landed in Firefox Nightly (pre-release version of Firefox for testing purpose) several months ago , and they went public recently. This shows how hard Mozilla has worked to develop, test , and improve this features before hitting the stable version.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/firefox-what-is-next/">previous blog post</a> that I have written in June 2017 (titled "Firefox : What is next ?") , I wrote about what Mozilla have done, will do , to improve Firefox and make it the most liked browser by all the Internet users.</p>
<p>Finally ! Mozilla's hard work is paying off and I expect that next month Firefox marketshare will be higher.</p>
<p>Can't wait to see Firefox 57 going to stable version. This new version that will be released next month will be the most revolutionary version Mozilla has ever made ! I promise you that Firefox marketshare will increase significantly after the release of Firefox 57.</p>
<p>If you want to find out what Firefox 57 will be like , checkout my blog post <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/firefox-what-is-next/">here</a>.</p>
