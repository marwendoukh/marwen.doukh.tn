<p>Many people asks : "How can I help Mozilla ? I'm not familiar with programming !" . Then answer is "Use Firefox Nightly !".</p>

<h2>What is Nightly ?</h2>
<p>In software development process , any program version have a life cycle , like we Humans , Alpha , Beta and release .</p>
<p>Alpha is the version that contains the latest features and technology , it not available to public because it's unstable and under testing.</p>
<p>Beta is almost stable version of the software , but it needs more testing to make sure it does not contain bugs or security issues.</p>
<p>Release is the most stable version of the software and it is available to public . It has been tested for many weeks and almost all the issues were fixed by developers.</p>
<p>Back to the main topic , Nightly is the alpha version of Firefox , it contains the most newest Firefox features that are not available to public ,it is under continuous testing by the community.</p>
<h2>How can I help Mozilla ?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned above , Nightly is unstable and contains the latest features , so Mozilla should test these features before making it publicly available .When installing Nightly , it will send anonymous data about how much RAM it consumes , how much it takes to start , how many times it crashes and the crash's cause ... (with all the respect to your privacy)Â  all those information will help the community to fix bugs and improve Firefox.</p>
<p>All the Mozilla community is working hard every day to make Firefox better whether by coding or testing. So you can be part of this and help to shape the next version of Firefox by simply installing Firefox Nightly and reporting any issue or bug you find.</p>
<p>If you want to test a more stable version of Firefox , you can install Firefox Beta from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> , it's the last chance to catch bugs before landing user's computers.</p>
<h2>What is coming next ?</h2>
<p>I've been using Firefox Nightly for more than a year , and during all this period , I'm receiving a new update every day , YES ! every day ! and I can notice that Firefox is improved day after day , new features are added , speed is improved , new privacy features are included regularly .</p>
<p>Since Mozilla is open , it shares periodically blog posts to tell the community what is coming next and what are the features that were added in the previous weeks , you can follow it by visiting the <a href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox Nightly blog</a>.</p>
<p>Finally , I would like to show you one of the most video I like , it summarize everything about Mozilla and I'm sure after watching it , you will set Firefox as your default browser.</p>
