<p>Hello Mozillian !</p>
<p>At this end of October 2016 , I've been in Casablanca in Morocco for 4 days to attend the Mozilla Arabic Gathering 2016. Roughly 30 Mozillians were present to discuss the new Mozilla projects and to make our strategy for the next years . I wrote a blog post to summarize what we've done , you can check it <a href="https://marwendoukh.wordpress.com/2016/10/30/mozilla-arabic-gathering-morocco-2016/" target="_blank">here</a> .</p>
<p>In this article , I'll dive into the details of the Mozilla Campus Clubs session that has been presented by Christos in the Mozilla Arabic Gathering 2016 .</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><img class="  wp-image-2670 aligncenter" src="/assets/8d9248e5-5bb0-4c29-8133-b97e82d94b8e.png" alt="Mozilla Campus Clubs" width="325" height="123" /></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Mozilla Campus Clubs definition</h2>
<p>A quick definition for a Mozilla Campus Club would be :</p>
<p>"A group of people who meet regularly to teach , learn , discuss  .... Simply , to make a difference in the Web " .</p>
<h2>Why Mozilla created this new program ? We already have the FSA !</h2>
<p>Before talking about this new born project , I would like to give you some historical information .</p>
<p>Mozilla has started a project called "Firefox Student Ambassadors" or FSA . It's a project that focuses mainly on the Firefox browser . As an FSA , our main mission was to teach students about Firefox . This project has some points that should be improved like the reporting . Mozilla doesn't have a clear idea about what an FSA did or what he is planning for . Another very important thing , everyone could become an FSA simply by submitting an online form , without any courses or any coaching , he will talk to people about the Mozilla mission . I thing that could cause some problems because not every student knows well about the Mozilla mission and the Mozilla principles .</p>
<p>Given all the above points , Mozilla start thinking how it could improve the FSA program and how to make the Mozillian mission easier . And PAM PAM ! It announced the Mozilla Campus Clubs !</p>
<h2>What is a Mozilla Campus Club ?</h2>
<p>As we defined it above , it's a group of people passionate about technology ,  not only the Mozilla products ,  who help each others to learn and to advance their knowledge . And as its name indicates , is focusing on the universities and the students . It's founded by student , in a student campus , to the students ! It couldn't be better !</p>
<p>Mozilla is committed to keep the web open , safe and accessible to everyone . So , a campus club is the better solution to spread the web literacy and to fuel the student innovation .</p>
<p>Mozilla Campus Clubs doesn't require any expensive resources to run :  a venue (it could be any place clean , safe and accessible) , and some members are enough to do a great job.Because the main goal of a Mozilla Campus Club is not gathering as much resources and swags as you can , but it's learning and teaching as much as you can !</p>
<p>As I mentioned above , the FSA program doesn't offer any resources or coaching that helps students spread the Mozilla mission effectively . That's why before starting his Mozilla Campus Club , the Club captain (The club founder / leader ) should follow an online course made by Mozilla that covers everything he should know. As of the time of writing this article , I'm still following the course and personally  I liked it so much but it can be improved by focusing more on visual materials (videos , pictures ) instead of text .</p>
<h2>Why should I start a Mozilla Campus Club ?</h2>
<p>Mozilla specifically and the open source in general , is based on sharing : sharing experience , sharing knowledge , sharing ideas .... sharing everything that could help others .</p>
<p>This fully aligns with the Mozilla Campus Clubs goal which is based on the same principle : Sharing .</p>
<p>Personally , and according to my personal experience , I think that teaching others about something makes you master it better and the audience questions will make you more excited to learn new things .</p>
<h2>I want to start a Mozilla Campus Club , what should I do ?</h2>
<p>Before starting a club , I highly encourage you to follow the Mozilla course , it will give you a clear vision about Mozilla mission and principles because you should be able to answer all the students questions and help them understand what is Mozilla .</p>
<p>If you are asking how to start it , all the process is mentioned in the Mozilla Campus Clubs website , every step is detailed .</p>
<h2>Briefly ...</h2>
<p>A Mozilla Campus Clubs is a group of people that meet in a safe / clean place to teach and learn technology . Every student who want to join this program , will be certainly guided by Mozilla so he will never be lost .</p>
<p>I'm very thankful to a great person  who gave me all those information during the Mozilla Arabic Gathering 2016 in Morocco  : It's Christos Bacharakis , from Mozilla . Thank you once again :)</p>
<p>I hope that the Mozilla Campus Club program will help students from all around the world to learn new things and I hope that it will be the manufacturer for a new fleet of developers , open web fighters , and of course new Mozillians !</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2452" src="/assets/2016-07-12-image-10.png" alt="2016-07-12-image-10" width="1100" height="618" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_blank">Rust</a> is a new systems programming language made by Mozilla , it's extremely fast !</p>
<p>In this tutorial we'll develop a program in Rust that translate words using the Yandex Translator API.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>Installing Rust</h2>
<p>Rust is always changing , this tutorial is made with version 1.14.0 (released in December 22, 2016).</p>
<p>To install the latest Rust version , run this command in your Terminal</p>
<pre>curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh</pre>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Create a new project</h2>
<p>Cargo is a package manager for Rust , it also create projects , build , and run it .</p>
<p>To create a new Rust project , run</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cargo new RustTranslator --bin</code></pre>
<p><span style="color:#993366;"> - -bin</span> indicates that we are creating a binary program and not a library.</p>
<p>Once you created the project , two files will be created</p>
<ul>
<li>Cargo.toml : contains the project dependencies and information (developer,version ...)</li>
<li>main.rs : contains our source code</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to src , with</p>
<pre>cd src</pre>
<p>to run the program , run</p>
<pre>cargo run</pre>
<p>This will prompt a simple hello world</p>
<pre>Hello, world!</pre>
<h2>Import dependencies</h2>
<p>Open Cargo.toml and add</p>
<pre>[dependencies]
hyper = "0.10.0"
rustc-serialize = "0.3"
hyper-native-tls = "0.2"</pre>
<p>Our project needs those libraries :</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyper : will help us make HTTP requests to get the word's translation from Yandex API</li>
<li>rustc-serialize : will help us parse the HTTP result</li>
<li>hyper-native-tls : Since Yandex Translator API is available in HTTPS , we need this library to make HTTP request to encrypted web services</li>
</ul>
<p>To import it to the project , run</p>
<pre>cargo update</pre>
<p>Just wait , this depends on your Internet speed.</p>
<h2>Coding ...</h2>
<p>We just finished importing the libraries we need , now we have to tell Rust that we will use it in our program . To do so , open  main.rs and add :</p>
<pre>extern crate hyper;
extern crate rustc_serialize;
extern crate hyper_native_tls;

<p>Networking is a key component of any successful company and especially critical for a startup. Totem Summit brings attendees a better way to network by sharing once in a lifetime activities with new friends. Because real relationships are built on shared experiences.</p>

<p><i>“Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.” - Albert Einstein</i></p>
<p>Emboldened by Albert Einstein’s words, the <a href="http://www.wonkalab.com" target="_blank">Wonka Lab</a> team looked to nature as the place of inspiration for their first ever, three-day <a href="https://www.totemsummit.com/" target="_blank">Totem Summit</a> launching on March 26, 2017. Serendipitously, they discovered Whistler, B.C. as the ideal place where rivers, mountains, and people meet.</p>
<p>Having been to numerous conferences around the world, the team felt the brief introductions made there lacked personal touch and lasting impressions. As mentioned above, the networking opportunities you take as a young company is critical to future success. With this in mind, the team explored an alternative way to bring innovators, investors, and entrepreneurs to new heights. They chose Whistler not only because it has vast possibilities for shared experiences, but because Whistler has proven itself as a hotbed for testing innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Whistler B.C. is the most connected resort community in the world and the best place to get your fill of snowy adventures in North America. The summit has something to offer for everyone: entrepreneurs looking for new opportunities, sport enthusiasts craving thrill, corporate innovators searching for their next star, and industry influencers vying for the spotlight. This one-of-a-kind conference adds play to work by providing attendees a chance to network through curated adventure activities like: snowboarding, skiing, snowmobiling, bobsledding, rejuvenating in an outdoor Nordic-inspired spa, attending unique storytelling sessions, and soaking in cultural marvels. All meant to build strong and lasting relationships.</p>
<p>So don’t miss out on your chance to attend and <a href="https://www.totemsummit.com/passes" target="_blank">click here</a> to find the pass that actually fits you!</p>

          <a href="/2017/01/01/my-expectations-for-2017/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">My expectations for 2017</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>During 2016 we've seen many great products that changed our life and also there are a lot of news happened that affected the tech world like the US election. There is always something new to come in the tech world , and obviously 2017 will not be an exception. In this blog post , I'll tell you, briefly, my expectations for this year 2017.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2>HTTPS</h2>
<p>In 2016, we've experienced a big increase in the HTTPS adoption by many websites .And this become a must-have for every website developer because user privacy is mandatory nowadays. Mozilla and many other big companies have sponsored a project called <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let's encrypt</a> which offers free TLS certificates for everyone.Recently, Mozilla announced that more than 50% of web pages visited by Firefox users were secured by HTTPS . This is a very important step toward a secure web .I expect that 2017 will be the year of HTTPS and I hope that more and more websites will be secured with HTTPS.</p>
<h2>Encrypted chat Apps</h2>
<p>Whatsapp , the 1 Billion users chat App announced that it can't access the content of the messages sent by its users because they are end-to-end encrypted. Same for Viber , Telegram (secret chat) , and Signal . The Snowden-approved chat App Signal , announced that it has an increase in its App download especially after the US election. Using one of these Apps , you can privately connect to your friends and family without being watched by big companies , governments and hackers. I expect that 2017 will be the year in which we can connect securely to our friends.</p>
<h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
<p>In 2016 , Mark Zuckerberg showed us an amazing demo for Facebook plan for the VR (Virtual Reality). Google also announced that Youtube is able to deliver a live 360° video , so you can attend an event 1000 miles away without leaving your home !</p>
<p>With many projects like Aframe (a Mozilla library for creating VR scene using HTML) , I expect that in 2017 we can visit many countries , attend Mozilla , Google , Apple events without leaving home , playing games in VR scenes ...</p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Lately in 2016 , we heard a lot about IA assistants like Google Assistant and Jarvis which is an AI assistant announced by Mark Zuckerberg. In 2017, I expect that AI will be integrated in most of 2017's products and help us make things done.</p>
<h2>2017 wishes</h2>
<p>I wish that Firefox , will get more market share because , honestly, it deserves to be the first browser in the world. In this moment , Mozilla is working on many privacy features for Firefox in its Nightly version (Alpha version) as well as integrating Rust into its browser, this will make it way faster.</p>
<p>Let's work hard to make our future better and let's put one foot in front of another everyday !</p>
